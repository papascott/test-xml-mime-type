			<title>A simple XML viewer?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When you view a normal XML file in the browser, Chrome gives you a simple, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/18/xmlviewofscriptingopml.png&quot;&gt;readable XML viewer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to invoke that viewer from a JavaScript app running in the browser. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Some kind of JavaScript call like&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt; window.xmlViewer (xmltext);&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The only other option is to rewrite it from scratch, which I'm open to doing but would rather not. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/226&quot;&gt;Does anyone know if such a thing exists&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;BTW, one of the things that kind of silently limits the size of RSS is the way browsers display RSS feeds. They can handle other XML types in a normal sensible way. But the RSS viewer is broken. I wish they would just let it be, and show it as a normal XML file. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/226&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'd love to discuss Markdown with people who know Markdown and use Drummer. We should have a Markdown nodetype. I've been playing around with it, but I'm not satisfied with what I have yet, not ready to lock it down. Here's &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/14&quot;&gt;an RFC&lt;/a&gt; with a link to an example.</description>

			<title>A week of Peloton</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've had my &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Peloton&lt;/span&gt; for a couple of weeks now. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I've done a session every day for the last six days. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;At first I didn't think I wanted to do the classes, but the second time I tried a class I was intrigued, then by the third, I was hooked. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The exercise on a Peloton is more than twice the exercise you get riding around the moutains on an E-bike. It's hard work going up the hills, but you get to just have fun going down, there's no work involved. So 20 minutes of Peloton riding equals 40 minutes of road riding. Only it's even more, because you're working harder. Always harder. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My legs feel stronger and healthier, and overall I feel that way too. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;An entirely positive experience, and my idea of what exercise is about is shifting in an interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And -- tomorrow I get my Tesla Model 3. So I expect some more major horizon busting is to come. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>There's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/09/10/twoWaysOfLookingAtAnOutline&quot;&gt;dichotomy&lt;/a&gt; in outliners -- 1.

Why did they choose a name that promises so much, and more than anything -- simplicity.

I shouldn't have to read a few white papers, and still not get it. Look, my intuition says that the web is the web is the web and there is no Web 3, there's just the web. I don't like that they usurped the name of something so simple and precious for something that looks scammy. I think they should have chosen a different name.</description>

			<title>My Peloton</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote this thread on Twitter this morning.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’ve had a Peloton for a couple of weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I got it so I could exercise when the weather is too nasty to go out for a ride or a walk.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’ve done classes and rides with no content. I don’t like the classes. The impersonal “you can do I it” motivation is a real turn off. Who the heck are you, and yiu have no clue who I am. Ugh.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why not have classes where you learn something? Then I’d look forward to it, instead of dreading it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I’m going to keep trying with the classes. Basically I am already motivated, I love the high I get from exercise. But I wouldn’t mind using the time to learn stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Then this evening I took a class with a teacher I really liked. And it made all the difference. I got a better workout, and I had fun. I even talked back a few times. Totally got into it. Weird. &lt;span class=&quot;spTagref&quot;&gt;Peloton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

I want to clarify that:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I appreciate the support. &lt;span class=&quot;spOldSchoolEmoji&quot;&gt;😄&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;I don't think I've ever &quot;begged&quot; though at times I imagine it might have seemed that way.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;And I haven't been promoting rivers to them for quite some time, because I think the problems are much bigger now. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think the most important thing news orgs can do to improve their service is to include ideas and perspectives from outside the newsroom, esp those that are critical of their work. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would encourage a news org to run a &lt;i&gt;river of sources&lt;/i&gt; their reporters consider authoritative. Blogs, newsletters, and whatever new &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_press&quot;&gt;forms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamphlet&quot;&gt;come&lt;/a&gt; up in the future. This would initially be an internal resource, but the obvious next step is to share the resource with their readers, in the interest of increasing news flow, broadening perspectives, and also introducing transparency. And perhaps most important to introduce criticism of their work to their flow, something we need and they need. If I were going to beg for anything that would most likely be it. I wrote about how this would work in more detail in &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2015/05/13/howToHaveAFuture.html&quot;&gt;May 2015&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When I read yet another NYT article or op-ed about how Facebook is letting us down, I keep wondering when they're going to look at how &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; contribute to this problem, how their coverage of Hillary's Emails, for example, gave Trump the White House, and set the country on the path to authoritarianism. I think they did far more damage than Facebook, and not surprisingly, that has not been examined to anywhere near the extent Facebook has. This is a serious problem, and it's not going to get better in the current news system.

			<description>When I was starting out in tech, after getting a degree in computer science, I was drawn to PCs because the adults hadn’t gotten there first. They were still simple. If they had kept their stuff simple, I might have invested on their platforms. The web after all these years is still really simple if you ignore Google and use common sense. It’s still possible to see the web as unspoiled as it was at the beginning. Just ignore Google and it’s all good.</description>

I have reserved a &lt;a href=&quot;http://drumkit.org/&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; for it. There's nothing there at this time but a placeholder. &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/PostMonsterG/&quot;&gt;Gary Teter&lt;/a&gt; came up with the name in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/PostMonsterG/2021/10/30/060526.html?title=moreDrummerThingsIpadEdition&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. When I read the post, I was pretty sure this was the name. I love how it connects to the name of the product, and it conveys the utility of having a language in a product such as Drummer. It also reflects the duality of the product. You can beat the drum in Drummer by writing, if you're a poet, and if you're a plumber, there's Drumkit. It's also nice because it leaves open the option of the language existing outside of Drummer, but no one will miss that the language &lt;i&gt;came from&lt;/i&gt; Drummer. That's important I've found. I left similar clues in RSS and in podcasting. I think naming a product is a community thing, the best names don't come from one person's mind. Gary understands a lot about what I'm trying to do with the language, how else could he have devised such a perfect name. He can be proud, much as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html&quot;&gt;Dannie Gregoire&lt;/a&gt; can be proud of coming up with the name we eventually used for what we were calling audio blogging, even though there's a British journalist who falsely claims to have coined the term. Already the Drummer community has made a great contribution to Drummer. Many thanks! 🥁</description>

			<title>Morning ramble</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I signed up for Twitter Blue for $2.99 under the mistaken impression that it got me through paywalls. Okay it doesn't do that. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I'd be happy to pay $100 a month, but even so I will not use Twitter as the primary way I read news. Not ever going to happen, I already have news reading tools that blow Twitter out of the water. Sorry Jack. I've been working on this stuff for a long time (just like you).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So we're still a really long way away from having rational networked news. Yet the deficiencies of news are what's killing us as a democracy and a world power. It isn't Facebook, that's just a diversion. Most people are falling for it. The problem is that the news system is sick. We talk about inequality in terms of how much money people have, but what about inequality in terms of the information they have access to. I pay for better news that poorer people can. But even with that I'm still  impoverished. News people are lazy. I can't believe they weren't all trying to get a real ticktock of Trump on January 6, starting on January 7 (give them a few hours to get over the shock). But I hear from the Washington Post that they thought they had an innovative idea to look into this in October! Holy shit. Is that what they think news is. Oy we are so lost. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I want news like they portrayed it in Hollywood when I was young. The shit where they go out to get the story that brings down the empire. The biggest story of 2021 is what was Trump doing, who was he calling, what threats was he making, when the insurrection was actually going on. I read the WP story. It's really weak. We should know a lot more by now. And this was happening all through the Trump presidency. The news was resetting expectations constantly, noting that Trump wasn't a normal president over and over. Well we figured that out thanks, now how about telling us what he's actually doing. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We're all information impoverished, just pretending we're informed, but in our hearts all of us knowing we have no idea what's being done to us in our own name.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>Why GitHub, for poets</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm sure the plumbers fully appreciate the value of hooking up a writing tool like &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/&quot;&gt;Drummer&lt;/a&gt; to the default place in the world for posting code. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;We can do a lot of renderings of outlines in Markdown, which is the writing language favored by GitHub. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Watch out, because the docs on GitHub are about to get an upgrade, the same kind of lift blogging gets from writing with an outliner.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Docs are even more structured than blogs.   &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Okay that's the plumber's rationale.  &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;For poets, think of GitHub as a great arena where all kinds of sports are played, except in this analogy the sports are ideas and docs. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Until now there hasn't been a great arena for poets. There's only been such an arena for programmers, and that's very new. GitHub didn't exist as the great programming idea arena until maybe the mid-teens. Maybe it's just now starting to come into its own.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Certainly a big publishing platform like Facebook and Medium had the opportunity to do this, but the too quickly pivoted to business models, and that had a chilling effect at making it a great arena for ideas. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Amazon, amazingly, had the best opportunity to create such an arena, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2017/01/18/enduserStorageFromAmazon.html&quot;&gt;begged&lt;/a&gt; them to do it, openly, but they wouldn't do it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;What does such an arena need? Not a whole lot actually.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A simple user authentication method. The technology for this is called OAuth. It's what everyone uses. It's what GitHub uses. Twitter does, Facebook, Slack, on and on. The important thing about this method of authentication is that YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT.  You use it, you don't even think about it. It makes sense to you. So right off the bat, you're ready to join in. I can put a command in a menu to &lt;i&gt;Log on to GitHub&lt;/i&gt; and you won't be surprised at all by what it does.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The only other thing it needs to do is storage, and GitHub does that, very powerfully. Have a look at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader&quot;&gt;ArtDownloader&lt;/a&gt; project for an idea. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/10/artdirectoryscreenshot.png&quot;&gt;huge amount&lt;/a&gt; of art there. It's great stuff. Hook it up to your screen saver, and enrich your life. It's free for you, and guess what, it's free for me too. GitHub says fine, we'll host it, you don't even have to ask. You can create your own repos. I promise you, it's not hard and we can probably even make it easier, given enough time. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Why is it such a great arena?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Because you can point other apps to the arena you write to using Drummer, and they can do stuff for you with that data. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;It's a fucking platform. It's free. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Another thing it is -- based on an open standard -- GIT. So we're not getting locked in the trunk here. We are free to leave. We are depending on their API which their competitors will hopefully clone. They'd be idiots if they didn't. They probably already are. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is where I like to work -- at the edge of possibility. We might be able to bootstrap something wonderful here. I am certainly optimistic myself based on the intelligence and curiosity of the people who are using Drummer. And their collegiality. That's the most important ingredient. I've had all this stuff for years, outliners, code that writes to GitHub, scripting interpreters, etc etc. But having all of it in a package that is used by enough smart people, to help start the bootstrap, that's like the sourdough starters everyone was trading in the early days of the pandemic. You can have all the ingredients, but if you don't have people to play in the arena, nothing interesting is going to happen. &lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;</description>

It's an amazing resource. And that made me think of MS-DOS because both are owned by Microsoft and storage is basically what MS-DOS did, and btw, MS-DOS is the one product they didn't use as a weapon when they were trying to usurp the web, so it has a nice taste to it, still.

			<description>I put about twenty &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Petty&quot;&gt;Tom Petty&lt;/a&gt; songs on my iPhone and have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lWJXDG2i0A&quot;&gt;listening&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqmFxgEGKH0&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; on and off. The thing about Tom Petty is his songs are the kind that you sing in your head all the time days and days awake or in dreams. To have twenty Petty tunes co-resident means you're living the Tom Petty lifestyle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMyCa35_mOg&quot;&gt;waiting&lt;/a&gt; for it to pass, but kind of hoping it doesn't.

He was part of the team that shipped ThinkTank, Ready and MORE. When we sold to Symantec, Scott went to NeXT where he was on the rollout team for their product. His heart was in outliners. He went on to start Aquaminds, which he explains in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/Scott-Love&quot;&gt;bio&lt;/a&gt; on Quora. Scott was a brilliant creative funny friendly and vulnerable human. He put his heart into everything he did. His boss, before he worked for me, Alfred Mandel, called him Nudgie. When I heard that I started using that name for him too, until I realized it might not be the nicest thing. Recently Scott and I reconnected on Twitter. In a private exchange he said he liked the name. I'm sorry his life was so short. His enthusiasm and big heart and super active mind will be missed.</description>

			<description>Scott and I had dinner many times, and often traveled together on business. We always joked about how we were going to take on the then-dominant tech company IBM.

			<title>Slavery formed us</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm reading two books at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Zookeepers-Wife-War-Story/dp/039333306X&quot;&gt;The Zookeeper's Wife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin&quot;&gt;Uncle Tom's Cabin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One about the Holocaust, the other about slavery. The pairing has me thinking about the differences. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This has been the year for me of reading about slavery. It has really been an eye-opening experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One observation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust&quot;&gt;the Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; was unthinkably horrible, but it wasn't slavery, the oppressors were trying to anihilate us, not enslave us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was over in five years. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Antisemitism is permanent, but it is not slavery. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States&quot;&gt;Slavery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/15/400-years-since-slavery-timeline&quot;&gt;lasted&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_colonial_history_of_the_United_States&quot;&gt;400 years&lt;/a&gt;, and imho it isn't over yet. It had a chance to form the whole culture of not just the US as some of our European friends sometimes imply, all white people everywhere are indicted. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other differences, but the thing most Americans don't get is that slavery is deeply rooted and it isn't over yet. And if we want it to be over, it's going to require a near-universal conscious decision to end it. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Scott &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/6#issuecomment-962586664&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; whether &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/?verb=http.client&quot;&gt;http.client&lt;/a&gt; does headers, and at first I said no, but then when I dug in, I realized yes, it does, for non-proxied calls, and with a simple addiiton it should work with proxied calls as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I made the change in the released web Drummer, so theoretically it should work now. I don't have something immediately available to test with. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you're expecting to do HTTP-related programming from Drummer, this is something you should pay attention and if possible participate in. This is an important verb, and it's important to get it right. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>JavaScript in Drummer</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://oldschool.scripting.com/PostMonsterG/?tab=blog&quot;&gt;Gary Teter&lt;/a&gt;, whose name I recognize from the Frontier community, I think -- has been writing eloquently about JavaScript and Drummer. I'm learning a lot reading how the product reflects off his mind. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And I agree totally about the potential for JavaScript which is being wasted by the way the language is being driven. We should be trying to coalesce it, not drive it apart into a bunch of incompatible languages. Reminds me of something &lt;a href=&quot;https://rms2.tumblr.com/post/35571080444/andrew-singer&quot;&gt;Andrew Singer&lt;/a&gt; who started Think Technologies (a company that should be remembered btw) -- in tech we don't stand on the shoulders of giants, we stand on their toes. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We have another chance to coalesce JavaScript. Drummer's language, which Gary has a name for btw, one that I like, removes the one imho sin of JavaScript that keeps it from being a scripting language. And I'm trying to hone a broad verb set, and writing good docs for them, and just in general slowing down and getting it right, looking at prior art, and not deprecting things that matter (like &lt;i&gt;request&lt;/i&gt; in Node.js, what a terrible idea!). It's all been very mindless. But JavaScript's universality is as important as say RSS's. It should be focused and developed. Yes, I am that ambitious for the language in Drummer which may soon have a name. 😇&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>Even sports journalism, where you'd think horseraces would make sense, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/images/2021/11/06/horseracesports.png&quot;&gt;they overdo it&lt;/a&gt;.

Poets and Plumbers. Users and developers. We're all smart, and love to learn, but in different areas and with different results. We multiply each others' work by learning how they think, what they care about, how they explain things. I've heard devs say that users just don't get how this works, only to realize later that their view is valid, and understanding it was key to creating tools they would love. That they would say &quot;this works like I think.&quot; When a user says that to you, believe me, it's the best feeling ever. An aside, my own father said that to me about ThinkTank. That was a big moment. So listening and trying to understand can produce fantastic results, and it goes both ways. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
